## Step 6
By now, you have a solid story and several story-threads, one for each
character. Now take a week and expand the one-page plot synopsis of the novel to
a four-page synopsis. Basically, you will again be expanding each paragraph from
step (4) into a full page. This is a lot of fun, because you are figuring out
the high-level logic of the story and making strategic decisions. Here, you will
definitely want to cycle back and fix things in the earlier steps as you gain
insight into the story and new ideas whack you in the face.
