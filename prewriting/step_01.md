# Step 1:
 Take an hour and write a one-sentence summary of your novel. Something like
this: “A rogue physicist travels back in time to kill the apostle Paul.” (This
is the summary for my first novel, Transgression.) The sentence will serve you
forever as a ten-second selling tool. This is the big picture, the analog of
that big starting triangle in the snowflake picture.

When you later write your book proposal, this sentence should appear very early
in the proposal. It’s the hook that will sell your book to your editor, to your
committee, to the sales force, to bookstore owners, and ultimately to readers.
So make the best one you can!

Some hints on what makes a good sentence:

- Shorter is better. Try for fewer than 15 words.
- No character names, please! Better to say “a handicapped trapeze artist” than
“Jane Doe”.
- Tie together the big picture and the personal picture. Which character has the
most to lose in this story? Now tell me what he or she wants to win.
- Read the one-line blurbs on the New York Times Bestseller list to learn how to
do this. Writing a one-sentence description is an art form.
