## Step 04
By this stage, you should have a good idea of the large-scale structure of your
novel, and you have only spent a day or two. Well, truthfully, you may have
spent as much as a week, but it doesn’t matter. If the story is broken, you know
it now, rather than after investing 500 hours in a rambling first draft. So now
just keep growing the story. Take several hours and expand each sentence of your
summary paragraph into a full paragraph. All but the last paragraph should end
in a disaster. The final paragraph should tell how the book ends.

This is a lot of fun, and at the end of the exercise, you have a pretty decent
one-page skeleton of your novel. It’s okay if you can’t get it all onto one
single-spaced page. What matters is that you are growing the ideas that will go
into your story. You are expanding the conflict. You should now have a synopsis
suitable for a proposal, although there is a better alternative for proposals .
