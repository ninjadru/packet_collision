## Step 5
Take a day or two and write up a one-page description of each major character
and a half-page description of the other important characters. These “character
synopses” should tell the story from the point of view of each character. As
always, feel free to cycle back to the earlier steps and make revisions as you
learn cool stuff about your characters. I usually enjoy this step the most and
lately, I have been putting the resulting “character synopses” into my proposals
instead of a plot-based synopsis. Editors love character synopses, because
editors love character-based fiction.
