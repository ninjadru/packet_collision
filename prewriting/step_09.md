## Step 9
(Optional. I don’t do this step anymore.) Switch back to your word processor and
begin writing a narrative description of the story. Take each line of the
spreadsheet and expand it to a multi-paragraph description of the scene. Put in
any cool lines of dialogue you think of, and sketch out the essential conflict
of that scene. If there’s no conflict, you’ll know it here and you should either
add conflict or scrub the scene.

I used to write either one or two pages per chapter, and I started each chapter
on a new page. Then I just printed it all out and put it in a loose-leaf
notebook, so I could easily swap chapters around later or revise chapters
without messing up the others. This process usually took me a week and the end
result was a massive 50-page printed document that I would revise in red ink as
I wrote the first draft. All my good ideas when I woke up in the morning got
hand-written in the margins of this document. This, by the way, is a rather
painless way of writing that dreaded detailed synopsis that all writers seem to
hate. But it’s actually fun to develop, if you have done steps (1) through (8)
first. When I did this step, I never showed this synopsis to anyone, least of
all to an editor — it was for me alone. I liked to think of it as the prototype
first draft. Imagine writing a first draft in a week! Yes, you can do it and
it’s well worth the time. But I’ll be honest, I don’t feel like I need this step
anymore, so I don’t do it now.
