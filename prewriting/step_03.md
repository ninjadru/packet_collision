## Step 3:
The above gives you a high-level view of your novel. Now you need something
similar for the storylines of each of your characters. Characters are the most
important part of any novel, and the time you invest in designing them up front
will pay off ten-fold when you start writing. For each of your major characters,
take an hour and write a one-page summary sheet that tells:

The character’s name
A one-sentence summary of the character’s storyline
The character’s motivation (what does he/she want abstractly?)
The character’s goal (what does he/she want concretely?)
The character’s conflict (what prevents him/her from reaching this goal?)
The character’s epiphany (what will he/she learn, how will he/she change?
A one-paragraph summary of the character’s storyline
An important point: You may find that you need to go back and revise your
one-sentence summary and/or your one-paragraph summary. Go ahead! This is
good–it means your characters are teaching you things about your story. It’s
always okay at any stage of the design process to go back and revise earlier
stages. In fact, it’s not just okay–it’s inevitable. And it’s good. Any
revisions you make now are revisions you won’t need to make later on to a clunky
400 page manuscript.

Another important point: It doesn’t have to be perfect. The purpose of each step
in the design process is to advance you to the next step. Keep your forward
momentum! You can always come back later and fix it when you understand the
story better. You will do this too, unless you’re a lot smarter than I am.
