## Step 07
Take another week and expand your character descriptions into full-fledged
character charts detailing everything there is to know about each character. The
standard stuff such as birthdate, description, history, motivation, goal, etc.
Most importantly, how will this character change by the end of the novel? This
is an expansion of your work in step (3), and it will teach you a lot about your
characters. You will probably go back and revise steps (1-6) as your characters
become “real” to you and begin making petulant demands on the story. This is
good — great fiction is character-driven. Take as much time as you need to do
this, because you’re just saving time downstream. When you have finished this
process, (and it may take a full month of solid effort to get here), you have
most of what you need to write a proposal. If you are a published novelist, then
you can write a proposal now and sell your novel before you write it. If you’re
not yet published, then you’ll need to write your entire novel first before you
can sell it. No, that’s not fair, but life isn’t fair and the world of fiction
writing is especially unfair.
