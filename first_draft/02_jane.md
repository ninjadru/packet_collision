Rachel slept in the oversize white bed. Her brown hair covering her brown closed eyes. Jane loved her eyes. It was one of the many things she loved about Rachel. Janes was not a romantic but Rachel had fit into her life at the exact right time and place. The sunlight streamed into the room through large glass windows. This had been a factory at one time. THe large windows had seen better days. The paint was peeling from the large metal frames. There was obviously enough lead in the paint chips on the these windows to drive a public health roar. BUt childern's services did not come to this neck of the woods.
Technically this building was not zoned for residential habitation. Which is exactly why none of the 100 plus lofts were rented as appartments. They were artists lofts. Lofts being in double air quotes. When Jane and Rachel had visited this place for the first time they were lead around by an older man who was as round as he was tall. He smelled of stale cigars smoke and cheap booze. He reiterated that this builkding was not zoned residential and that theses were not apartments.

"Here is the studio, not an apartment, you can't live here...here is the kitchen, you can't live here... here is the bathroom, you can't live here...here is the bedroom, you can't live here"

It was comical. Everyone knew what was going on, everyone was in on the joke. Jane and Rachel signed the rental form and agreed that they would not live there. They immediatly moved their few posions into the loft that day. This had been their home and their refuge since then.

It wasn't much to look at. One large room with fifteen foot high ceilings. a small kitchette which consistanted of an old washtub sink and a hot plate. They added a small microwave and a refrigerator. The bathroom was small and the plumbing in this building was not the greatest. Jane found that if she showered early in the day the hot water and overall water pressure lasted almos through a reasonally lengthed shower.
