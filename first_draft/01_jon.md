Jon had a list. It was a list of everything that he owned. This list was 125 lines. Each item had a line. When he started this list was thousands of lines. He had gotten it down to 112 at one point. The actual number did not concern him. This wasn't a game or a score. This was about not letting things get in the the way of living. To obsess over getting that number lower was contry to that way living living. It was the balence that Jon was after. The exact tipping point in which the things overpowered the living. He held his cup item 43. In it was tea that he made with item
65. One Stainless steele kettle
and item
86. One small white teapot

Jon owned little so what he did own was relished. It was the top of the line best of the best. THe tea was small batch free trade organic green tea. It had a vegitable aroma and came in sealed pouches from and upscale shop specailizing and selling only tea. He bought several ounces at a time. Several diffenrt kinds of tea went into his backstock. He usually splurged and bought an onuce of something he had never tasted before. He liked to try new things but rarly did those illict a response that moved them into his backstock. Being a minimalist his backstock was rather small. He generally had two of the white vacummed sealed pouches. He liked a strong tea for waking up. After his meditation. After his yoga. This was his routine. His ritual. Everymornig he sipped a strong tea as he wrote in his journal.

Every morning began with his morning pages. It was something he had picked up from a self help book. Early in the day you wrote filling a page of thoughts. These thoughts would guide you for the day. They unleashed hidden dreams, desires and goals, or something to that effect. The self help book had faded to a memory in Jon's mind. A vauge understanding of you can heal your self. It was not very well written and had overtly shouded itself with amystical spritiual slant.

Despite his eastern phiosphical lean Jon had been a devote catholic. He had end every entry in his journal with a prayer. Every morning page contained a hail mary. The prayer itself offered little in terms of spiritaul guidence but the ritual of it help guide him.
23. One black moleskine journal one page per day.
He rarely ever went back and read his journals. They were typically just a braindump and tohughts that had lingered. It was more of the act that drove him. Everymorning he simply wrote a page in his book while sipping tea after yoga and mediatation.

Today was no different he reflected on his tiredness that week. He was not by nature a n ealry riser and had been up too late too many times this week. He was finshing up a job for a client and was looking to be free again. At this point he rarley had the need to take on work. His living expense were rather small and he mostly took on work to keep his mind and skills sharp. Also to appease Nancy. Nancy was his sort of headhunter/project/manager/pimp. She contacted him with any work that fit his skill set and took a nice 15% finders fee. Jon didn't mind it was a good arangement. She found him work from time to time and he was able to keep food on his table.
12. One wooden table can be used as a desk

He had finished the job last night and uploaded the code to the client just after midnight. And here he was up too eraly shaking the static from his head putting toughts to paper. When he had finished writing the last of his hail mary he cupped his tea and drank another cup. He pulled his laptop from its storage shelf and opened it.
03. One 2015 macbook pro
He pulled the laptop onto his computer desk which also served as his table which also served as his writing desk. To say that Jon's house was small was an undestaemnt. It was just over 100 square feet. It served his needs and he was completely happy with it. Everything he need was there and nothing was wasted. His balence was manitianed.

He opened his laptop and it came to life. THere was a slight pause as the laptop connected to the wifi and he paiently watched the half circles of the wifi icon move up and down. When his network connection was established he opened his email. He had converted to a gmail account early into the beta when the coveted @gmail.com was invite only. A friend had invited him and he had enjoyed the email service for several years now. However he had recently switched back to thunderbird. It was one of the few "desktop" applications that he liked. He had found that in the browser his email tab kept getting lost or closed. Now he had a purpose built application that he could swtch to anytime with a keybaord short cut. He liked that, it made him feel good to have a simple application to check his mail. One that didn't get in the way of browsing the web or wrting code.

An email from Nancy sat at the top of is near empty email box. The client was happy with the code he had written and the payment would be held up in the customary net 60 days. Jon was glad to be finished with the job and happy that he now had funds for the next few months. Nancy had also written
