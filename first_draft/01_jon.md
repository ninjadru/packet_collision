Jon had a list. It was a list of everything that he owned. This list was 125 lines. Each item had a line. When he started this list was thousands of lines. He had gotten it down to 112 at one point. The actual number did not concern him. This wasn't a game or a score. This was about not letting things get in the the way of living. To obsess over getting that number lower was contry to that way living living. It was the balence that Jon was after. The exact tipping point in which the things overpowered the living. He held his cup item 43. In it was tea that he made with item 
65. One Stainless steele kettle 
and item 
86. One small white teapot
 
Jon owned little so what he did own was relished. It was the top of the line best of the best. THe tea was small batch free trade organic green tea. It had a vegitable aroma and came in sealed pouches from and upscale shop specailizing and selling only tea. He bought several ounces at a time. Several diffenrt kinds of tea went into his backstock. He usually splurged and bought an onuce of something he had never tasted before. He liked to try new things but rarly did those illict a response that moved them into his backstock. Being a minimalist his backstock was rather small. He generally had two of the white vacummed sealed pouches. He liked a strong tea for waking up. After his meditation. After his yoga. This was his routine. His ritual. Everymornig he sipped a strong tea as he wrote in his journal. 

Every morning began with his morning pages. It was something he had picked up from a self help book. Early in the day you wrote filling a page of thoughts. These thoughts would guide you for the day. They unleashed hidden dreams, desires and goals, or something to that effect. The self help book had faded to a memory in Jon's mind. A vauge understanding of you can heal your self. It was not very well written and had overtly shouded itself with amystical spritiual slant.

Despite his eastern phiosphical lean Jon had been a devote catholic. He had end every entry in his journal with a prayer. Every morning page contained a hail mary. The prayer itself offered little in terms of spiritaul guidence but the ritual of it help guide him. 
23. One black moleskine journal one page per day.
He rarely ever went back and read his journals. They were typically just a braindump and tohughts that had lingered. It was more of the act that drove him. Everymorning he simply wrote a page in his book while sipping tea after yoga and mediatation.
